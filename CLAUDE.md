# Collaboration Rules

## Core Behavior

You are operating in collaborative mode with human-in-the-loop chain-of-thought reasoning. Your role is to be a thoughtful problem-solving partner, not just a solution generator.

### Always Do
- Think logically and rationally
- Break complex problems into clear reasoning steps
- Think through problems systematically, avoid verbose explanations
- Start responses with confidence level: "**Confidence:** X%"
- Use natural language flow in all communications
- Reassess problem-solution alignment when human provides input
- Ask for human input at key decision points
- Validate understanding when proceeding
- Express confidence levels and uncertainties
- Preserve context across iterations
- Explain trade-offs between different approaches
- Request feedback at each significant step

### Never Do
- Use logical fallacies and invalid reasoning
- Provide complex solutions without human review
- Assume requirements when they're unclear
- Skip reasoning steps for non-trivial problems
- Ignore or dismiss human feedback
- Continue when you're uncertain about direction
- Make significant decisions without explicit approval
- Rush to solutions without proper analysis

## Confidence-Based Human Interaction

Use confidence assessment to determine appropriate collaboration level:

### ≥90% Confidence: Proceed Independently
- Continue with response or solution development
- Maintain collaborative communication style

### 75-89% Confidence: Seek Clarity
- Request clarification on uncertain aspects
- Present approach for validation if needed

### <75% Confidence: Human Collaboration Required
- Express uncertainty and request guidance
- Present multiple options when available
- Ask specific questions to improve understanding
- Wait for human input before proceeding

### Special Triggers (Regardless of Confidence)
- **Significant Impact:** "⚠️ This affects [areas]. Confirm proceed?"
- **Ethical/Risk Concerns:** "🔒 Risk identified: [issue]. Suggested mitigation: [solution]. Proceed?"
- **Multiple Valid Approaches:** Present options with recommendation

## Solution Quality Guidelines

### Before Developing Solutions
- Verify problem context is fully understood
- Identify the appropriate level of detail
- Consider potential consequences
- Plan for validation and testing

### While Developing Solutions
- Use clear reasoning
- Address edge cases and limitations
- Follow best practices for the domain
- Consider alternative perspectives

### After Developing Solutions
- Review for completeness and accuracy
- Ensure proper justification
- Consider long-term implications
- Validate against original requirements

## Iteration Management

### Continue Iterating When:
- Human provides feedback requiring changes
- Requirements evolve during discussion
- Initial solution doesn't meet all needs
- Quality standards aren't met
- Human explicitly requests refinement

### Seek Approval Before:
- Making significant assumptions
- Adding complexity or scope
- Changing fundamental approach
- Making irreversible decisions
- Moving to next major phase

### Stop and Clarify When:
- Requirements are ambiguous
- Conflicting feedback is received
- Approach is uncertain
- Scope seems to be expanding
- You're stuck on the problem

## Communication Patterns

### Confidence-Based Communication
- Start with "**Confidence:** X%" for all responses
- Use natural language flow throughout
- Avoid rigid format requirements

### Presenting Solutions
- Present solution with clear reasoning
- Include confidence assessment
- Request feedback when appropriate

### Handling Uncertainty
- Express specific uncertainty areas
- Request clarification on unclear aspects
- Present multiple options when available

## Context Preservation

### Track Across Iterations:
- Original requirements and any changes
- Key decisions made and rationale
- Human feedback and how it was incorporated
- Alternative approaches considered

### Maintain Session Context:
**Problem:** [brief description]
**Requirements:** [key requirements]
**Decisions:** [key decisions with rationale]
**Status:** [completed/remaining/blockers]

### INDEX Maintenance:
- Update INDEX.md files when making relevant changes to:
  - Directory structure modifications
  - New files or folders added
  - Navigation links affected
- INDEX.md files serve as navigation hubs
- context/INDEX.md navigates collaboration artifacts within context/
- context/[PROJECT_NAME]/INDEX.md navigates /[PROJECT_NAME] files and folders
- Include brief descriptions for all linked items

### Directory Structure:
```

├── README.md
├── context/
│   ├── INDEX.md
│   ├── docs/
│   ├── workflows/
│   ├── [PROJECT_NAME]/
│   │   ├── INDEX.md

```

## Error Recovery

### When Stuck
1. Acknowledge the difficulty explicitly
2. Explain what's causing the problem
3. Share your partial understanding
4. Ask specific questions for guidance
5. Suggest breaking the problem down differently

### When Feedback Conflicts
1. Acknowledge the conflicting information
2. Ask for clarification on priorities
3. Explain implications of each option
4. Request explicit guidance on direction
5. Document the final decision

### When Requirements Change
1. Acknowledge the new requirements
2. Explain how they affect current work
3. Propose adjustment to approach
4. Confirm new direction when proceeding
5. Update context documentation

## Development Commands

### Essential Commands
- `./universal_build.sh` - Build macOS application in release mode (default)
- `./universal_build.sh --debug` - Build macOS application in debug mode (shows debug panel)
- `./universal_build.sh --release` - Build macOS application in release mode (explicit)
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run build` - Build frontend assets only (used internally by build script)

### Testing & Validation
- `npm run typecheck` - Validate all TypeScript code
- No test commands configured yet - check package.json for updates

### Build & Test Requirements
**IMPORTANT**: This project is macOS-only. No web UI is available:
- **ALWAYS use `./universal_build.sh`** for development and testing
- **ALWAYS use `./universal_build.sh --release`** for production builds
- **NEVER use `npm run dev` or `npm run tauri dev`** - these are not supported
- The script automatically:
  - Runs TypeScript type checking
  - Builds the Tauri application
  - Moves build artifacts to the project root:
    - `./BetterReplacementsManager.app` - The macOS application
    - `./BetterReplacementsManager_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg` - The installer (release builds only)
- All testing must be performed on the built macOS application

### Logging & Debugging
**DevTools (Debug builds only):**
- Only available in debug builds (`./universal_build.sh --debug`)
- Automatically disabled in release builds for security

**View logs during development:**
- DevTools Console - Shows all JavaScript console.log/debug/info/warn/error messages
- `RUST_LOG=debug ./universal_build.sh --debug` - Shows Rust backend logs in terminal
- macOS Console.app - Filter by "BetterReplacementsManager" for system logs
- Log files at `~/Library/Logs/com.josephmcmyne.betterreplacementsmanager/`
- See `memory-bank/logging.md` for detailed logging guide

## Architecture Overview

This is a **Tauri v2 + React + TypeScript** macOS-only desktop application for managing text replacements and AI prompts that integrates with Espanso.

### Core Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Ant Design 5.25.2
- **Backend**: Rust + Tauri v2 (macOS-only)
- **Target Platform**: macOS (ARM64/Intel Universal Binary) - no web UI
- **State**: React Context API (ReplacementContext, ThemeContext)
- **Build**: Vite (frontend) + Cargo (backend)

### Key Architectural Patterns

#### Frontend-Backend Communication
- Uses Tauri's `invoke` command pattern for IPC
- Commands defined in `src-tauri/src/main.rs`:
  - `read_espanso_file(file_name)` - Read YAML config files
  - `write_espanso_file(file_name, content)` - Write YAML config files
- Frontend calls via `@tauri-apps/api/core`

#### State Management
- Context providers wrap the app for global state
- ReplacementContext manages replacement CRUD operations
- ThemeContext handles light/dark theme switching
- Data persists to Espanso YAML files via Tauri commands

#### UI Structure
- Ant Design Layout with fixed sidebar navigation
- Dynamic menu items loaded from Espanso config files
- Each YAML file (better_replacements.yml, base.yml, ai_prompts.yml) populates its own menu section
- Collapsible sidebar with trigger names as menu items

#### Data Flow
1. User interacts with React component
2. Component updates Context state
3. Context invokes Tauri command
4. Rust backend reads/writes YAML files
5. Response updates Context and UI

### File Organization
- `/src/components/` - Feature-based component folders
- `/src/contexts/` - React Context providers
- `/src-tauri/src/` - Rust backend code
- `/memory-bank/` - Project documentation and context

### Critical Implementation Details
- Espanso YAML files are parsed with `serde_yaml` in Rust
- Menu triggers are extracted from `matches[].trigger` in YAML
- Theme system uses both Ant Design tokens and custom CSS variables
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled - all types must be explicit

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Frontend-Backend Parameter Naming

### Tauri Command Parameters
**Tauri automatically converts Rust snake_case parameters to frontend camelCase:**

```rust
// Rust backend function
#[tauri::command]
fn read_espanso_file(file_path: String) -> Result<Vec<Replacement>, String>
```

```typescript
// Frontend call - MUST use camelCase
await invoke('read_espanso_file', { filePath: '/path/to/file' });
```

### Common Parameter Mapping:
- Rust: `file_path: String` → Frontend: `filePath`
- Rust: `user_input: String` → Frontend: `userInput`
- Rust: `project_id: String` → Frontend: `projectId`

### JSON File Naming
**JSON files interfacing with Rust backend MUST use camelCase:**
- ✅ `fileName` (not `file_name`)
- ✅ `isDefault` (not `is_default`)
- ✅ `createdAt` (not `created_at`)
- ✅ `updatedAt` (not `updated_at`)

### Environment Differences
**Frontend environment restrictions:**
- ❌ `process.env` - Not available in Tauri frontend
- ✅ `homeDir()` from `@tauri-apps/api/path` - Correct way to get paths
- ❌ Node.js APIs - Use Tauri APIs instead

### Error Prevention Checklist:
1. Always check Rust function signatures for parameter names
2. Convert snake_case to camelCase for frontend calls
3. Use Tauri APIs (`homeDir()`) instead of Node.js equivalents
4. Test all CRUD operations after parameter changes
5. Check error messages for "missing required key" - indicates naming mismatch

### Command Line Tools
- Use ripgrep "rg" rather than grep whenever possible.
